# Car-Fit
A platform to help people by providing daily life services like carwash. Main focus of this app is to teach/learn MVVM architecture and data binding without using any third party libraries. For backward compatibility we do not use combine framework as well (PS: This was very challenging 😅)


- 📱 iOS Application 
- 🌏 Rest API Server made using Flask. 
- 💫 MVVM Architecture
- 🎉 No third Party Libraries
- 🤠 Backward compatibility, compatible with older ios versions also.
